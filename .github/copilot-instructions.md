## Mod Overview and Purpose
**Yayo's Caravan (Continued)** is an update of the original YAYO's mod designed to enhance the visual representation of caravans on the world map in RimWorld. This mod provides customization options for players to modify how caravans appear and interact with the game world, allowing for a more tailored and immersive gameplay experience.

## Key Features and Systems
